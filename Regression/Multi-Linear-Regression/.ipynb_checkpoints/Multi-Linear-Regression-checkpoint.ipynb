    "It works on the principal of ordinary least square(OLS) / Mean Square Error (MSE).  In statistics ols is method to estimated unkown parameter of linear regression function, it's goal is to minimize sum of square difference between observed dependent variable in the given data set and those predicted by linear regression fuction.\n",
